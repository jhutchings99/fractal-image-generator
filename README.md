# Fractal Image Generator

In my CS-3005 C++ class at Utah Tech University, 
our semester long project was to build a fractal image 
generator. It contains a Command Line Interface (CLI) version that allows 
users to input parameters such as the fractal type and resolution, and a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) version with an interactive display for 
generating and viewing fractal images.
